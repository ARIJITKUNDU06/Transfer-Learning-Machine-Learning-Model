# Transfer-Learning-Machine-Learning-Model
 In this Project the dataset have been used to extract the features and the feature have been used
 by CNN layer and the extracted features from the model have been used as input to BPN model .
  By doing this transfer learning the efficiency have been increased to 98.39 percent with 82 percent
 less training time
